"Aayush was my TA this quarter for a machine learning course at the University of Washington. He was extremely helpful, took initiative, and was able to work very independently. He clearly has a large set of technical skills and know-how in data science/machine learning. I am happy to recommend him."

"I am so grateful for Aayush's help as my TA this quarter. Not only was he always a step ahead on his work, but he also went out of his way to see what else he could do to help. His knowledge of python was impressive, he was very self-reliant and he even provided the students with great feedback and guidance. I would recommend him in heartbeat."

"I have worked with Aayush at the institute level student body of KJ Somaiya College of Engineering from 2016 to 2018. Aayush worked as the Sports Secretary and played a very crucial role in managing the sporting activities of the entire college. He is a focused and goal-driven person who relies on a structured approach to get his work done. His leadership was on display when he led a team of over 150 students at our national level sports festival. Due to his multifaceted personality, we were also able to get numerous companies on-board for our events. His tenacity and zeal helped to raise the standards of all our events. He was always the go to person for all the junior members in the team and excelled in the role as a mentor. Aayush will be a valuable asset to any team he joins and I wish him the best for the future."
